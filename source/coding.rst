Coding Standards
######################################

C and C++
======================================

File Types
------------------------------------------------

- C++

  - Headers: ``.hpp``

  - Implementation: ``.cpp``

- C

  - Headers: ``.h``

  - Implementation: ``.c``

The reason behind this is so we can use C and C++ in parallel with one
another, without confusing what language any given file is written in.

Naming Conventions
------------------------------------------------

- Variables: ``lower_snake_case``

- Constants: ``SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE``

- Functions: ``lower_snake_case``

- Classes: ``UpperCamelCase``

- Filenames: ``lower_snake_case``

Formatting
------------------------------------------------

- Use OTBS bracketing and indentation style.

..  code-block:: c++

    if (x == y) {
        x++;
        foo();
    } else {
        x--;
        bar();
    }

- Avoid code beyond 80 characters. Never exceed 120 characters.

- Indentation should use tab characters (4 space width), with spaces for
  further alignment.

- A switch's block should be indented, and each case's block should be
  indented in the same manner.

- Line up lists so a) the start of list item lines align, and b) the end of
  list item lines roughly align. Each line should end with either a comma or,
  in the case of the last line, the closing token.

..  code-block:: c++

    string names[9] = {"Bob", "Fred", "Jim",
                       "Chris", "Dave", "Jack",
                       "Ozymandius", "Randall",
                       "Andrew"};

- Pointer and reference indicators ``*`` and ``&`` should be aligned to the
  type part of the statement, not the name.

- Insert space padding around operators.

- Insert space padding after parenthesis headers (after ``if``, ``switch``, etc.)

- One-line blocks (i.e. one line ``if`` statements) should still have brackets.

Comments
------------------------------------------------
- Use CSI Commenting Standard.

  - All functions and variables should have a doc comment at declaration.

  - CSI comment *every logical block*.

  - Header files and standalone implementation files should *always* have
    CSI-style description and license comments at the top.

- Use ``//`` and ``/* ... */`` for CSI comments.

- When a comment spans multiple lines, prefer multiline ``/* ... */`` comments.
  We recommend using line-leading ``* ``.

..  code-block:: c++

    /* This is a multiline comment
     * that spans multiple lines.
     * See how nice this looks?
     */

- Use ``///`` and ``/** ... */`` for doc comments.

  - Each parameter description in doc comments should be preceded by ``\param``
    on a new line.

  - The return description in doc comments should be preceded by ``\return``
    on a new line.

- Do not commit commented out code.

- Avoid inline comments whenever possible.

- Use ``//TODO``, ``//NOTE``, and ``//FIXME`` notation where necessary.

Structure
------------------------------------------------

- ``main.c`` and ``main.cpp`` should reside in the root directory.

- ``.h`` and ``.hpp`` files should be in an the ``include/`` directory. For
  libraries, header files should be in a ``<project>`` subfolder (i.e.
  ``include/anari/`` or ``include/pawlib/``).

- ``.c`` and ``.cpp`` files should be in the ``src/`` directory.

- Documentation files should be in the ``docs/`` directory.

Python
======================================
Based on `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>`_ and
`PEP257 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_.

.. WARNING: Indent with 4 spaces, NEVER tabs! Many IDEs can be configured
   to use "soft tabs," inserting 4 sapces when you press TAB.

Naming Conventions
------------------------------------------------

- Variables: ``lower_snake_case``

- Constants: ``SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE``

- Functions: ``lower_snake_case``

- Classes: ``UpperCamelCase``

- Filenames/Modules: ``lower_snake_case`` (Underscores discouraged,
  however. Avoid when possible.)

Formatting
------------------------------------------------

- Four-space indentation ONLY.

- Avoid code beyond 80 characters. Use ``\`` as necessary to break lines.
  Never exceed 120 characters.

- Line up multi-line structures as follows, with the opening and closing
  brackets on separate lines, and the start of the items lined up. Each
  item *may* be on its own line, but this is not required.

..  code-block:: python

    names = [
        "Bob", "Fred", "Jim",
        "Chris", "Dave", "Jack",
        "Ozymandius", "Randall",
        "Andrew"
    ]

Comments
------------------------------------------------
- Include docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules, following
  `PEP257 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_

- Please avoid inline comments. Comment above lines.

- Use single line comments when possible. (``#``)

- Please comply with the CSI Commenting Standard as much as possible.

- Use ``#TODO``, ``#NOTE``, and ``#FIXME`` notation where necessary.

- All files should precede with CSI-style description docstrings and
  license comments.

- Do not commit commented out code.

Python Code Formatter
-----------------------------------------------

`black` should be used as the code formatter.
