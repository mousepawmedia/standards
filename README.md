MousePaw Media Standards
=====================

MousePaw Media has authored a number of standards to guide their
ongoing software development efforts. These standards are
made freely available for the benefit of the open source
community, and the programming community at large.

More information can be found on the [Standards][1] page.

Standards Format
--------------------------

The standards are all written in RestructuredText format,
to be compatible with Sphinx. The root of the repository contains
a makefile which can be used to generate the documents.

On a Unix system, you can use the following commands:

    $ make html # Create HTML version.
    $ make latex # Create LaTEX version.
    $ make latexpdf # Create PDF via LaTEX.
    $ make man # Create man pages.
    $ make epub # Create e-book.

There are additional make targets as well. To see the complete list, simply run...

    $ make
